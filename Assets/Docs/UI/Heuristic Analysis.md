#Heuristic Analysis

##Visibility of system status (How clearly communicated is the UI?)
//1
Bar at the top left is ambiguous in its purpose
the options in the option menu have no feedback on their actual effect and there is no accurate scale with which to measure their impact
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
The green bar at the top left isn't clear in what it represents.
The options are small and should take up more of the screen since that is the main focus, rather than being able to see the background of the game.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
Green bar in top right needs to be more prominent and telling into what it is for
The options need to be working but theresume and otions buttons themselves work
Preferably lock the camera controls when using the pause menu?
Make it more obvious that escape is what you need to press to access the settings and other options
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Match between system and real world (Does it use basic language and not jargon?)
//1
it uses no language for the bar in the top left
options are relayed acceptably
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
Pause menu is clear but within the options, the UI has been moved over to the top left rather than staying in the middle. Also the options themselves have no lables and are unclear.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
Yes it uses basic language however the options could perhaps use more telling phrases
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##User control and freedom (Is there an easy way to exit out of the menus[If applicable])
//1
the leave button does not work
it is reasonably simple to exit the menu
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
The leave button does nothing. Buttons are small and hard to press, making it hard to navigate.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
Yes but it does not work
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Consistency and standards (How consistent is the layout?)
//1
the buttons are consistent in styles. the bar in the top left uses colours in a different way and stands out
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
All buttons are laided out in a similar way, with the same font. Stretching the game window does not break the UI.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
The layout and ease of use of the UI is to a consistent standard
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Error prevention (How easy is it to misclick/make a mistake in the UI?)
//1
it is difficult to make a mistake in the ui
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
Buttons are small and in the options menu are too close together making it easy to hit the wrong button.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
Buttons need to be bigger as it is possible to misclick
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Recognition rather than recall (How easy is it to remember where to go in the UI?)
//1
it is very easy to know where to go
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
The UI is simple and easy to remember, though the options should move moved from the top left.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
Very easy tp understand and remember
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Flexibility and efficency of use (Are there shortcuts to get around the UI?)
//1
there are no shortcuts but the ui is minimalistic
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
There are no shortcuts, it is simple so efficent to use.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
There are no shortcuts but it is simple and efficient
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Aesthetic and minimalist design (How minimal and unique is the UI?)
//1
the ui is not unique however it is minimalistic and easy to navigate
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//2
The UI is barebones, but in general easy to navigate, barring the location of option sliders and dropdowns.
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//3
the design is very minimal and could use to be bigger
//
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
