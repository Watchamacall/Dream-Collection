	*The participants didn't know what the green bar was so I added some text to show that it is in fact a health bar.
	*The options was mentioned to be rather small so I increased it's size.
	*Visual feedback was missing within the options so I added some visual feedback.
	*It wasn't clear that pressing *ESC* closed the options so text saying that 'ESC' closes the menu has been added.
